### [Live Demo](https://adamnizol.github.io/Particle-Drawing/)

Particle Drawing makes use of 2D Verlet Physics to steer a flock of particles which draws the images underneath as they move. Each particle has a slight attraction to the mouse which allows the user to hover over areas to guide more particles and improve the image quality around the cursor.
